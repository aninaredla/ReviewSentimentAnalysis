# Project Goal
- Evaluating Sentiment Analysis performance on bank customer reviews in India and North America using python NLP.
- This project was done in a jupyter notebook in Google Colab.

## Dataset Summary
The project utilized customer review data from both Indian (d1 in code) and hypothetical North American (d2 in code) banks. These datasets included varied feedback on banking services, enabling a comparative analysis of sentiment classification.

## Skills Used
Applied statistical and NLP techniques to preprocess text, analyze sentiment, and conduct topic modeling. Evaluated model performance with statistical tests and visualizations, highlighting insights from different geographic datasets.

## Technical Skills
Leveraged Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, nltk and re for text preprocessing, scikit-learn for machine learning models, and matplotlib for data visualization. Additionally, scipy.stats was used for hypothesis testing, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling.

## Real-World Impact
This project underscores the feasibility of applying traditional Python NLP pipelines across diverse datasets, aiding businesses in extracting actionable insights from customer feedback. The comparative analysis can guide banks in tailoring services to regional customer needs.

## Visualization Descriptions
- Confusion Matrices: Displayed the accuracy of sentiment classification models for Indian and North American datasets, highlighting classification disparities.
- Bar Charts from LDA Topic Modeling: Illustrated the most influential topics within positive, neutral, and negative reviews, providing insights into customer concerns and preferences.
